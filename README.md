# Hunter
It's my first graphical project of my first year at Epitech.

Run ./my_hunter -h for the rules.

If you haven't got the CSFML library you can download it here : https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/index-fr.php

If you don't want to download it there is a demonstrate video called "Hunter_demonstrate.mp4".
